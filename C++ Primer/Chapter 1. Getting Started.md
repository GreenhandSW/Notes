1. Writing to a Stream

   ```c++
   #include <iostream>
   std::cout << str << std::endl
   // endl prints a "Enter" and ends the output flow.
   ```

2. File Redirection

   ```powershell
   program.exe <infile >outfile
   ```

   the upper code redirects the input and output of "program.exe" to "infile" and "outfile", respectively.
